I answered an email and got drawn into the world of mentoring, Python, and robots.  It started innocently enough, I answered an email from our company's STEM coordinator.  Then I followed a conversation on a team site.  Soon I was ordering a Raspberry Pi Pico (only $4), assorted parts, and learning Python as quickly as I could.  I was hooked.  I built a few projects, and then a series of simple robots.

The next thing I knew, I was talking to a few teachers at a Philadelphia Title 1 school.  They were interested in having me mentor middle school and high school students, helping them learn Python and build robots as I did.  Yikes, now I had to build a curriculum, get funding, buy parts, and teach!  Fortunately, my co-workers were available to help.  Funding came from our company's STEM outreach program, curricullum came from a variety of sources (CoderDojoTC, work my co-workers graciously shared, and my own projects), and parts quickly came from orders placed online.  We were able to put together two different kits, one based on the Pico with a variety of input/output devices, and one with a robot chassis, a sensor, and the Maker Pi RP2040.  Both kits were assembled for approximately $20 each.  Once the students learned Python, they could transfer those skills to working with the kits to build games and, eventually, self driving cars.

I would be lying if I said my first class was flawlessly executed.  The link that the teacher sent me was blocked by my company's firewall.  Moving to my personal laptop solved that problem, only to find that their school account only allowed their school's students and teachers access to the link.  Fortunately, another teacher had a personal account we could use.  The first class had six boys and three girls, with varying levels of programming experience.  It was terrifying and increadible at the same time.  I can't wait to meet the students for another class!
