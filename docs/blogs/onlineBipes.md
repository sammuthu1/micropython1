**Moving to being hosted online**

[Rafael Aroca](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafael-aroca-85b57b5/) developed the BIPES application.  I started contributing his BIPES GitHub repository as I made changes to the offline version that I built.  Eventually, Rafael was
kind enough to open up his server and allow me to host my updated code there.  "My" version of BIPES now includes sections that support the Raspberry Pi Pico, Raspberry Pi Pico W, and the
Maker PI RP 2040.  The backend code has been patched to support the MicroPython implementation that is specific to the Raspberry Pi foundation's UF2 interpretor.

A version of BIPES supporting the above can now be found by following this [link](https://bipes.net.br/pico/ui/)
